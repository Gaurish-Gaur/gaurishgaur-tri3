TPT 3/15/22 Notes (5.3 + 5.4):
  * Bias can exist in programming
  * Prone to human based biases, ie race based
  * Connects back to my research on emotional AI, how they can reflect the bias we all may inherintly have
  * Intnetional bias can exist, such as targeted ads, is that necessarily bad?
  * HP Computer are Racist video, prob didn't do it on purpose, but esp smaller comapnies can have toruble if not having diverse work force on which they can test on
  * Crowdsourcing can help correct biases, since can reach beyond community
  * Wikipedia is good example, but is it reliable like amny teachers point out as not being?
  * Well, inr ealtiy, are able to peer check the ethics and reliability of each of their writing and various authors
  * Cyrpo and blickchain is another great example since eneds to be val by at least 3 independent miners
  * COVID date is easy to recog, crowsourcing could protect lives
  * Crowdsourcing wee have practived by like using API and other peopl'es codes and lists
  * Crowsourcing on Github since can interact with greater community

  * Watched the video, very interesting
  * I think the video creator is very angry and might think it's intentional. However, I think that the facial recognition wasextremely likely not purposefuly designed in that way. Instead, it is much more likely, that like the comapny did not spend enough resources on the rpoper testing and research to make sure they were ready to capture a diverse audience. I think a way to fix this is to ensure that there is diversity when considering positions in STEM, and trying to engaged typically udnerserved and udnerepresetned communities. This will especially becomme more and more important as we become more intertwined  into AI and the future, Especially since AI can pick the innherent biases we have as humans, it is essential that we make sure that we avoid any such biases when making determinations like Insurance hikes or healthcare premiums. Something I can do is try to advoacte for more diversity and representation is STEM programs.

  * A crowdsource idea for our group is to ue our numbers to help gather evidence. For example, we could crowdsource the people in our class for classes like our stats class. We see how we use the students in our class as datapoints to make larger surveys or argumentative statements. This way we might even be able to profitize our information as to sell datw represnetative of the tpical AP CSP class at the socieoconimc level of DNHS. We could crowsource different ideas of sponsors and what type fo projects they would like. This was, students can use the list of options to decide which one will be best for the to go ahead and try to implement.
  * DNHS crowwdourcing would be ven better as datapoints. The data would become repersentative of not just APCSP students, but even students at Del Norte as a whole. This would be helpful for those research on students and our behaviors of those students of the average socioenomic levels that Del Norte is in. This would be a better representation of perhaps a normal high schooler since, not all students will go ahead and really take AP classes. We could crowsource information like diffivulty of certain classes and teachers.
