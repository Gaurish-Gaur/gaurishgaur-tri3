TPT 3/22/22 Notes (5.5 + 5.6):
  * Lawyers make proffesion on patetnts
  * thinking about application like on General Public Licensing (GPL)
  * Qualcomm makes money on oatents, GPL software could vilate rights to charge for software
  * Open Source says that any code is free and shared
  * Qualcomm wants royalties in order to make sure they make money
  * Black Duck Software helps teams manage sec and quality that come from open source
  * Important to know when borrowing software what type of licese you're getting it from
  * Need to learn how to addd license communities and other stuff
  * The license we may ofpt for could be like MIT License
  * Creative common licnese and considering legality and ethicality of it
  * we may not agree on a license but we must abide by it for the law
  * amazed Red Hat not selling Linux Distributionm had amazing IPO as public company
  * free distribution allows more dominance, open source are free term
  * PII is Personal Identifiable Information
  * Person that looks at likedin will also look at like our Insta or Facebook
  * PII consdierations that everyone may know, things that are not as well know like mothers maiden name, and those absokutely secret like SSN
  * always keep SSN to yourself unless absolutely need to give away
  * Factors to increase Sec of System is like Multi Factor Auth
  * SSL uses both assymetric and symmetric encryption
  * assymetric crypt is also public-key crypto
  * Nefarious use of interent is like phsising or other virus schemes
   
 Git Action (5.5)
  * (1)Please look at my notes above: some licenses that we talked about if Creative Commons CCO that waives copyright interest in work you've created it to WWW. MIT license is wha tur group ultimately decided because we can used code freely. Open source GPL License is tgere because lets people do whatever they want except distribute it
  * (2)We chose the MIT license because it could help other high school debate teams make their own website, and it's not like we're making ti for profit.

 Git Action (5.4)
  * (1)PII is PErsonal Identifiable Information are broader identifiers that can be ascribed to person. Some PII I have seen in CompSci Principles like the name of the students, our assignment grades, class grades, the names of our team memebrs, crossovergroups,a nd partners, and even perhaps our groups #.
  * (2)My feeling for PII, especially secretive ones, is that they should not be asked for. Especially when it comes to things like ones social security number, I know a good rule of thumb is to never, ever share it because they could determine if your finances are all in check and that your identity will not be stolen from or anything.
  * (3)Good passwords are ones that random and not something that somebody would guess. Make sure they are not ones that are popular and striagh up the same one as everyone else. And make to never, ever repeat paswords for different programs over and over again. Another step to help in auth is two step, that can make sure that nobody but you is the one logging in.
  * (4)Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a process that uses a pair of related keys -- one public key and one private key -- to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access or use.
  * (5)An example of ecnryption we've use in deployement is https and certbot that we used last tri, well at leas some groups.
  * (6) One time myfreind, I ahdn't talked to for a long time, sent me an email to open a link that would help him since it was a survey. Obviously, it was a phising scam and thus it caused myself to et hacked into my Gmail and google account. Luckily I was able to thwart the attack, and the emails it was sneding toe veryone else, by changing my passowrd immediately. Some other phising techniques would be those ads that are like click here to have a chance to win a thousand dollars or sometjing.
