### Test #1
* Q1
* >> Questions says LEAST likely. Misread question. Should consider that Tech to store data sets change as size change, so larger data sets by nature need more storage and more storage space. Instead the program is not really affected by the # of programming statements. Techniques to store data sets change as the size of data sets increase. Larger data sets by their nature require more storage space.
* Q5
* >> "The activities of a user browsing in an anonymous window will not be visible to people who monitor the user’s network, such as the system administrator" is wrong. Instead, "Items placed in a Web store’s shopping cart for future purchase during the anonymous browsing session will not be saved on the user’s computer" is correct. I shoudl've known this and was going to put it. However, I reconsidered my answer,nwhich was a mistake. The reason would be that the cookies wuld clear, the reason I changed it is because I thought that maybe they could be logged in or something. Items placed in a Web store’s shopping cart for future purchase during the anonymous browsing session will not be saved on the user’s computer. If a user is working from a network, such as at work or at school, the administrator of that network can monitor all activity of a user, including information that is sent to the Internet.


* Q15
* >> My answer of using a public key encrytipion to transmit credit card info. Tus is wrong because Public Key Encryption bis qidely used because it easily tackles many cryber sec concerns. However, reserving a hotel room is a great personal sybersec risk toa  hotel. As an email message passes through the Internet, it goes through intermediate computers and routers. These computers and routers could read the contents of the email. The credit card number could be read from the email.

* Q21
* >> Which of the following best describes the relationship between the World Wide Web and the Internet? I amwrong in my answer since the internet is not a data stream. Instead, the internet is an interconnected network of networks, and the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet.

* Q23
* >> Which of the following has the greatest potential for compromising a user’s personal privacy? As I said earlier in the public key for encryption is totally normala nd safe to use,a nd is veyr aminstream. Instead the cookies being stored by the web broswer are the biggest threat. Aggergation fo cookies could threaten security since data collection.

* Q24
* >> Which of the following best explains how data is typically assembled in packets for transmission over the Internet? Each packet contains multiple data files bundled together, along with metadata describing how to categorize each data file. Each packet contains multiple data files bundled together, along with metadata describing how to categorize each data file. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data. This is the correct answer and this really is just a def question,

* Q25
>> An author is considering publishing an e-book using a Creative Commons license. In which of the following situations would it be better for the author to use a Creative Commons license instead of a traditional copyright? I answered one, int aht teh author qants to make the e-book available as a free download. But the aswer would also mean three, and the author twant to allow people permission to use and modify the e-book. In toher words, the Creative Common slicense means the author can stupulate what kind of mod is allowed for users too.


* Q29
  >> A programmer wrote the program below. The program uses a list of numbers called numList. The program is intended to display the sum of the numbers in the list. In order to test the program, the programmer initializes numList to [0, 1, 4, 5]. The program displays 10, and the programmer concludes that the program works as intended. This option is correct. Because the variable sum is initialized to store the value of the first element of numList, and because the iteration block is a FOR EACH loop, the value of the first element is added to sum twice. Since the first element of the list is 0, adding this number to the sum does not affect the sum. A non-zero first element would give an incorrect result. In general, a single test case is not sufficient to confirm that a program works as intended. This option is incorrect. The program does not work as intended. On the test case [9, 1, 4, 5], the program displays 28 but the correct sum is 19. In general, need more tha one.


* Q37
  >>The following code segment is intended to set max equal to the maximum value among the integer variables x, y, and z. The code segment does not work as intended in all cases. Which of the following initial values for x, y, and z can be used to show that the code segment does not work as intended? the asnwer is x=3, y=2, aad z=1. Oh that is wrong because x could still be greater than z, but just because y is less than z, then z is assumed to be the largest.
  

### Test #2
* Q3
>> Which of the following actions is most likely to raise legal or ethical concerns? A Public Interest groups trying to raise aweness would not cause ethical concerns. Still need permissions to use work as samples under Creative Commons License. So you need permission still in order to be free from any ethical concerns. 
* Q8
>> Which of the following is NOT an advantage of using open-source software? It is incorrect to say that Unlike commercial software, which can become obsolete when the company that created it goes out of business, open-source software can be updated without the involvement of the original programmers. This is incorrect becase open source software can be continualy updated still becaue it is made availbe to public. So this IS an advantge. Instead  Open-source software has source code that is released under a license that allows users the rights to use and distribute it. However, there is no guarantee that the original developer of open-source software will provide support for its users. that's why that is not a benefit, since it's not a guarantee.
* Q19
>> In the following procedure, assume that the parameter x is an integer. Which of the following best describes the behavior of the procedure? I saiid it would display false otherwise, Incorrect. When x is not negative, y is assigned the value false and the display statement is never executed. In other words, nothing would be displayed if, X is less than zero since it wouldn't even run.
* Q41
>> The owner of a clothing store records the following information for each transaction made at the store during a 7-day period. My answer is incorrect ebcause we do not know the cost of individual items. Instead, wee can determine total number of items on a data and count them.
* Q43
>> The question below uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially in the center square and facing toward the top of the grid. The following code segment is used to move the robot in the grid. Which of the following code segments will move the robot from the center square along the same path as the code segment above? The correct answer is the one with the correct order that Count is zero then it would repeat 4 time sthe move forward and rotate left
* Q45
>> The teacher wants to determine whether students who play a sport are more or less likely to have higher grade point averages than students who do not play any sports. Which of the following pairs of spreadsheets can be combined and analyzed to determine the desired information? Spreadsheets I and IV is incorrect since that is only those with more than one sport, but we would need at least one sport. not just more than just one sport, since that would not include people who play one sport, so need spreadsheet 1 and II.

## Test #3
* Q4
* >> I forgot to answer the question. The correct answer, is of course, The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols. This is ow two computers can communicate. They can do so because the standard protocols is what they use to uniform the process.


* Q6
* >> I selected the first correct answer. However, I did not also selected D. This is also correct. This algorithm displays the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20. After 20 is displayed, x is incremented to 21. The value 21 is not displayed since it is a multiple of 3 and the algorithm terminates.


* Q18
* >> The procedure traverses this list and never encounters a positive value. The procedure then returns false as intended. Therefore,

* Q26
* >> Yes, the correct answer is onee that guides the robot appropraitely. Or in other words, the robot starts along the side of a black region. Step 1 moves the robot just past the end of the black region. Step 2 rotates the robot to the right and moves it forward, placing the robot along the next side of the black region. Step 3 will repeat steps 1 and 2 to move the robot around the other 3 sides to complete a circuit around the black region. I had no answer, previously

* Q34
* >> Heuerestic is not applicable here because it is in a lingear order and procedure and matters. This is also very applciable tot he materials of CSP. As this algorithm has a factorial efficiency, it does not run in a reasonable amount of time. A heuristic approach can be used to find an approximate solution than can run in a reasonable amount of time.

* Q40
* >> I did not answer this. The correct answer should be between line  and line 10. Inserting Win, left arrow, true between line 9 and line 10 will cause the loop to terminate when the guess is correct.

* Q50 Values assigned to first and second 
* >> MY answer is incorrect. The variable first is initially assigned the value 100, and then later assigned the value of second, which at that point in the code segment is also 100. The variable first is initially assigned the value 100 and the variable second is initially assigned the value 200. Next, temp is assigned the value of first, which is 100. Next, second is assigned the value of temp, which is 100. Last, first is assigned the value of second, which is 100. After execution, both first and second have the value 100.
