Reflection on Last Trimester! (how does this even work?)

Night at the Museum: N@TM is a way for us last trimester to view what other visual arts/creative classes. For example, I really liked the art we saw. I especially like the drama tech we saw where we kind of got to see behind the curtian on how dramas actually works. Maybe I'll do that in the the future if my CS career doesn't work out.

What can I do with Tech to improve mine or others education?: I will use tech to improve my education because I can use it to problem solve real problems I face in my life. For example, if I need to createa program that is able to organize and createa schedule in which to do my homework, I am no wable. Thus, I am also able to work on my problem solving and collaboration skills that will improve my education and real-life job skills that will be extremely important in my near future. I can use tech to improve other people's future by being able to integrate and use tech toa ddress real problems, while also showing them hoe technolgo can be used to combat the digital divide.

Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing Three more beneficial effects of computing are problem solving, hand-eye coordination, and also learning collaborative skills. Three more harmful effects of computing are eye strain, furthering the digital divide, and also that is can take away from the real issues.
Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? Dopamine issues are real for sure. For example, the dopamine rush of completing a game or engaging on social media can distract sudents. For example, would I rather work on a long-term project or get the short term satisfaction of just playing a game for a bit longer. I am still impacted, but not too much, since I don't really play games since they're too boring, but the same concept exists.

How does someone empower themself in a digital world? Now more than ever, in a digital world, it is important to empower ourselves by like becomign familiar with tech and they way it is. One way to do so would be like by making sure that you are familiar with the digital world. this would mean taking classes like Computer Sciecne in the rela world with Mort and Naidu.
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? By empowering them too. For example, you could help them learn the concept or at least not be as alien to other types of technology they mayb not be familiar with, for example with like elders.
Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? Something we could do is petition the school to get rid of the internet block. For example, it doesn't make sense that block the internet and like useful sites just to stop people from playing game. The bueracrats don't seem to know that our phones already have a lot fo the games and we can use vpn so it's really just an unneccessary restriction.
