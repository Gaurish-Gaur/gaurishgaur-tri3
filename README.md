Reflection on Last Trimester!

Night at the Museum: N@TM is a way for us last trimester to view what other visual arts/creative classes. For example, I really liked the art we saw. I especially like the drama tech we saw where we kind of got to see behind the curtian on how dramas actually works. Maybe I'll do that in the the future if my CS career doesn't work out.

What can I do with Tech to improve mine or others education?: I will use tech to improve my education because I can use it to problem solve real problems I face in my life. For example, if I need to createa program that is able to organize and createa schedule in which to do my homework, I am no wable. Thus, I am also able to work on my problem solving and collaboration skills that will improve my education and real-life job skills that will be extremely important in my near future. I can use tech to improve other people's future by being able to integrate and use tech toa ddress real problems, while also showing them hoe technolgo can be used to combat the digital divide.
